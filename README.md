# Open AR AI Master's

### I am proud to announce the upcoming launch of Open Artificial Intelligence (AI) x Augmented Reality AR (AIR) Master's. 

Inspired by [Clare Corthell's Open Data Science Masters] (http://datasciencemasters.org/) and [ARVR Academy] (http://www.arvracademy.io), I wanted to create something accessible to show the relationship and connection between AI and AR. While many separate the terminology, and most notably now homogenizing the term "XR" (x as anything) related to virtual, augmented, mixed, merged realities etc.; here I focus on the connections between computer vision and computer graphics in the "real," world.

Curriculum and other blogs forthcoming, look out for future posts!
